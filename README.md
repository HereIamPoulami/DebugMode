Debugger for the PDE (Processing Development Environment)
---------------------------------------------------------

[www.processing.org](http://www.processing.org)

The goal of this project is to develop a working prototype of a tool for debugging Processing sketches. One of Processings main strengths is its suitability for learning and teaching programming and generative design. Having an easy to use debugging feature available should facilitate teaching and understanding program flow in general as well as fixing actual bugs.
Features include the ability to set breakpoints on specific lines and subsequent stepping through the code while examining variable values. Ideally breakpoints can be set by interacting with the main PDE window and are indicated by highlighting the appropriate lines. A similar indication needs to be used for the current statement when execution is halted.<br />
